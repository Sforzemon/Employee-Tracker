# Employee-Tracker

This application is an employee tracker and management system.

You can view employees, update thier managers, or remove them entirely.
You can view employees by manager.

All of this is done in the node, so to use this, you will need to copy the repository, and then run npm install to have the proper modules that I have prevented from uploading.

Also, having mySQL is a must, seeing as how this application connects to databases there and lets you manipulate them and pull information.

Modules used:
mysql
inquirer
console.table

Enjoy
